👩🏻‍🏫 I am a PhD candidate in art history at the University of Delaware, where I study Atlantic world art and material culture.

🔎 My research focuses on the materials and politics of art during the eighteenth century.

🖍 My dissertation, "Crayon Rebellion: The Material Politics of North American Pastels, 1758-1814," investigates the role of the pastel medium in shaping revolutionary ideas and settler-colonial identities.

🏛 I am a 2024-2025 Smithsonian Institution Predoctoral Fellow at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. Read more about my work [here](https://americanart.si.edu/research/fellowships/fellows/megan-baker).
